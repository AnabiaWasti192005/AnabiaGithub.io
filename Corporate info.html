<p>In 1997, a young and enthusiastic businessman from India founded the Thumbay Group in the UAE. He set up the UAE’s first private medical college in Ajman, 
    which later became a full-fledged medical university, the Gulf Medical University (GMU). Confronted with the challenge of providing adequate clinical training opportunities for its students, 
    he built the first private teaching hospital in the region, which laid the foundation of Thumbay Hospitals.</p>

<p>Soon after Thumbay Hospital – Ajman was launched, it emerged as a popular healthcare destination in the country, encouraging Thumbay Group’s healthcare division to set up a string of teaching hospitals at various locations in the UAE.
     This was in addition to a network of state-of-the-art family clinics ‘Thumbay Clinic’, a chain of pharmacies 
    ‘Thumbay Pharmacies’ and a series of diagnostic centers ‘Thumbay Labs’ across the country.</p>

<p>Today, the man behind Thumbay Group, Dr. Thumbay Moideen heads the highly successful and diversified business conglomerate, as its Founder President. The group has diversified into around 20 brands, with presence across 16 sectors of business including Education, 
    Healthcare, Medical Research, Diagnostics, Retail Pharmacy, Health Communications, Retail Opticals, Wellness, Nutrition Stores, Hospitality, Real Estate, Publishing, Information Technology, Trading, Marketing & Distribution</p>
